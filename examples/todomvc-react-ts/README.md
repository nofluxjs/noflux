This is an implementation of [TodoMVC](http://todomvc.com/) built using:

- [React & ReactDOM](http://facebook.github.io/react/) 15.4.2
- [Noflux](https://github.com/nofluxjs/noflux) -.-.-
- <del>[Redux](https://github.com/rackt/redux) 3.6.0</del>
- [TypeScript](http://www.typescriptlang.org/) 2.2.1

It is adapted from the [redux TodoMVC example](https://github.com/rackt/redux/tree/master/examples/todomvc).
